Graceful degradation and service workers are connected to improve user experience, because graceful degradation ensures that an application remins functional even when some features fail, prioritizing core functionality. Service workers intercept network requests and caching to allow web applications to function without internet connections. Thus both align in the principle of maintaining usability despite obstacles.
